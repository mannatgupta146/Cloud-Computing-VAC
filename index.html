            <h2>Module quiz: Computer Networking</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>WAN</strong> (A Wide Area Network covers a larger geographical area than a MAN, such as countries or continents).</li>
                <li><strong>A mesh network has multiple paths</strong> (This is its defining feature, providing redundancy).</li>
                <li><strong>True</strong> (The bus topology became obsolete as more efficient and reliable star topologies, which use hardware like hubs, switches, and routers, became the standard).</li>
                <li><strong>Security risks</strong> (Transmitting data over radio waves (Wi-Fi) is inherently less secure than a wired connection).</li>
                <li><strong>hexadecimal numbers</strong> (IPv4 uses dotted-decimal notation, while IPv6 uses hexadecimal notation).</li>
                <li><strong>Network and host sections of an IP address</strong> (The subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into these two parts).</li>
                <li><strong>IPv6 has built in security</strong> (IPsec is a mandatory component of IPv6) and <strong>IPv6 does not support Broadcast traffic</strong> (It uses multicast and anycast instead).</li>
                <li><strong>C-class</strong> (In classful addressing, Class C networks were designed for small networks, e.g., the 192.168.1.0 range).</li>
                <li><strong>True</strong> (The default gateway is the IP address of the router that a computer uses to send data to any other network).</li>
                <li><strong>False</strong> (The default subnet mask for a Class B network is 255.255.0.0. The mask 255.0.0.0 is for a Class A network).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-section">
            <h2>Module quiz: Network devices and protocols</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>False</strong> (A <strong>router</strong> is used to join different networks and subnets. A switch connects devices <i>within</i> the same network).</li>
                <li><strong>Presentation</strong>, <strong>Application</strong>, and <strong>Session</strong> (The TCP/IP Application layer combines the functions of these top three layers of the OSI model).</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong> (This is the specific term for a setup that combines a private cloud with public cloud services).</li>
                <li><strong>Remote</strong> (A "Remote Access VPN" allows individual users, like someone at home, to connect to the office network).</li>
                <li><strong>Email</strong> (SMTP is for sending email, while IMAP and POP3 are for receiving email).</li>
                <li><strong>TLS</strong> and <strong>SSL</strong> (HTTPS is HTTP secured by either Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)).</li>
                <li><strong>443</strong> (HTTP uses port 80, and the secure version, HTTPS, uses port 443).</li>
                <li><strong>DNS amplification</strong> (This is a DDoS attack that uses open DNS servers to flood a target with a large volume of DNS response traffic).</li>
                <li><strong>Quality of Service (QOS)</strong> (QoS is the suite of tools and mechanisms used to manage network traffic).</li>
                <li><strong>grep</strong>, <strong>findstr</strong>, and <strong>Select-String</strong> (<code>grep</code> is for Linux/macOS, <code>findstr</code> is for Windows Command Prompt, and <code>Select-String</code> is for Windows PowerShell).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-section">
            <h2>Module quiz: Network security</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Request-response model</strong> (This is the most common model, where a client sends a request and the server sends a response).</li>
                <li><strong>Rules</strong> (Firewall rules, also known as access control lists or ACLs, use these components to decide whether to allow or block traffic).</li>
                <li><strong>Packet-filtering</strong> (This is the most basic type of firewall, which operates at the network layer).</li>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the-middle</strong> (This attack describes an attacker secretly positioning themselves between two communicating parties).</li>
                <li><strong>Penetration testing</strong> (Specifically, this is a <strong>phishing simulation</strong>, which is a common part of a penetration test).</li>
                <li><strong>Listening to the communication between two network devices</strong> (Network sniffing involves capturing and inspecting data packets).</li>
                <li><strong>Administrator access</strong> and <strong>Superuser access</strong> (Both terms refer to accounts with the highest level of privileges).</li>
                <li><strong>False</strong> (RADIUS, TACACS, and LDAP are primarily <strong>authentication</strong> protocols, which verify <i>who</i> you are).</li>
                <li><strong>True</strong> (This four-step process is often remembered by the acronym DORA: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge).</li>
                <li><strong>DHCP relay</strong> (A DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP broadcast packets between different subnets).</li>

        <div class="quiz-section">
            <h2>Module quiz: Cloud computing and networking</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Worldwide access</strong>, <strong>Scalability</strong>, and <strong>Easy to manage</strong> (Cloud platforms like Azure are designed to be globally accessible, scalable, and managed centrally).</li>
                <li><strong>Cost</strong> and <strong>Dependence on Internet connectivity</strong> (At a very large scale, costs can be a disadvantage, and a reliable internet connection is a critical dependency).</li>
                <li><strong>Hosted</strong> (Type 1 hypervisors are "bare metal," and Type 2 hypervisors are "hosted" on top of an OS).</li>
                <li><strong>Compute-optimized</strong> (Real-time big data processing requires high-performance processors for computations).</li>
                <li><strong>Machine learning (ML)</strong> (ML is the specific field of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data to identify patterns).</li>
                <li><strong>(a) Reactive machines, (b) General AI</strong> (Reactive machines are the simplest AI. Artificial General AI (AGI) is the theoretical, future type of AI).</li>
                <li><strong>OpEx</strong> (Operational Expenditure (OpEx) is a pay-as-you-go model for ongoing costs, like subscriptions).</li>
                <li><strong>SaaS</strong> (Software as a Service. Microsoft 365 is a complete software application accessed over the internet).</li>
                <li><strong>True</strong> (In the SaaS model, the provider manages everything; the customer just uses the software).</li>
                <li><strong>True</strong> (SaaS applications are delivered over the internet, so bandwidth is critical for them to function).</li>
            </ol>

                <li><strong>Yes</strong> (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Slack).</li>
                <li><strong>Yes</strong> (e.g., Shopify, Wix, or Squarespace).</li>
                <li><strong>SaaS refers to the delivery of software applications over the internet.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Yes</strong> (Azure provides many cloud services that would be beneficial).</li>
                <li><strong>Improved scalability</strong>, <strong>Cost savings</strong>, and <strong>Increased physical security</strong> (These are key benefits of moving from on-premises to the cloud).</li>
                <li><strong>Yes</strong> (Suggesting a firewall is a key part of improving network security).</li>
                <li><strong>Firewall</strong> (This is the specific function of a firewall).</li>
                <li><strong>Yes</strong> (Creating a network diagram is a standard planning step).</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing network performance</strong> and <strong>Identifying potential single points of failure</strong> (A diagram helps visualize the network to spot bottlenecks and redundancy gaps).</li>

                <li><strong>WAN</strong> (The internet is the largest Wide Area Network).</li>
                <li><strong>IP</strong> (The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing and routing).</li>
